# Regression Project for XG

## Project Description 
This project focuses on predicting Expected Goals (xG) in football matches using a linear regression model.
By analyzing shot data from various matches, the model aims to estimate the likelihood of scoring based on different factors like shot location, match context, and player statistics. 
This analysis provides valuable insights for coaches, analysts, and fans regarding team performance and scoring efficiency.
